                                        Many people have asked questions regarding the history of e-Sword, this ministry, who I am, etc. This page will hopefully answer some of those questions,
                                        as well as provide a time line of how GOD has blessed this effort.I (Rick Meyers) was born in 1962 in sunny southern California, saved by the grace of
                                        GOD in 1980, married my beautiful wife in 1988, and have two wonderful childrenâ€”a daughter and son, in that order.<br />
                                        The Holy Spirit chose to give me the gift of teaching, which I have been using since 1991.<br />
                                        It was this same time that He gave me the desire to program computers (funny how that works).<br />
                                        Nine years later GOD combined my passion for His Word and my pleasure of programming, and e-Sword was birthed!
